# Synergy-Summer-School-2025

Welcome to the repository for the Synergy Summer School 2025 lecture in Ischia! This repo contains materials and Jupyter notebooks for hands-on sessions.

## üìö Contents

- **MacroecologicalPatterns.ipynb**  
    Analyze the Tara Ocean dataset, focusing on OTU (Operational Taxonomic Units) to explore some macroecological patterns.

- **VoterModel.ipynb**  
    Simulate species dynamics using the Voter Model to understand ecological processes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to open the notebooks directly in Google Colab‚Äîno installation required!

1. Click the **Open in Colab** badge below or next to each notebook.
2. In Colab, go to **File ‚Üí Save a copy in Drive** to work on your own version.
3. Follow the instructions in each notebook to get started.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the notebooks locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/epigani/Synergy-Summer-School-2025.git
```

Then install the required Python packages (see `requirements.txt` if available) and open the notebooks in Jupyter.

## üì¶ Data

The Tara Ocean dataset, along with metadata about sampling stations and OTUs, is included in the repository and loaded automatically in the notebooks. No additional downloads are required.
